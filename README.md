# Brain Teaser

## Overview
this is a simple CLI based program designed to act as both a study aid and fun little brain teaser, similar to crossword puzzles on a newspaper.

Clearly this is very early stage but I plan to have brain teaser questions up to calculus level questions, nothing that would make your head explode but enough for someone to practice the mathematical core of each section. As well as a couple of handy guides/function sheets to aid those who either haven't touched the material before or haven't touched it in a while.

Currently I only have basic arithmetic in the core game functions and it doesn't function in a loop

### installation guide:

As mentioned before its rather early stage and my make file isn't even properly set up just yet but if you would like to take a look at my code and see what I've got you could individually build each file or browse what little code I've got. 

Stay tuned and I will soon put together a real makefile and it could actually be ran
